ðŸ—£ ORDER BY command cannot be used in a Subquery. GROUPBY command can be used to perform same function as ORDER BY command.

ðŸ—£ The WHERE clause helps specifies which record(s) will be deleted. If you omit the WHERE clause, all records in the table will be deleted!

ðŸ—£ If a subquery (inner query) returns a null value to the outer query, the outer query will not return any rows when using certain comparison 
operators in a WHERE clause.

ðŸ—£ NULL is a special marker used to indicate that a data value does not exist in the database.

ðŸ—£ GROUP BY treats NULLs as valid values. Which means, rows with an unassigned values, will be counted and assigned to an empty space.
Example: Group by department - IT = 2, MED= 4, " " = 3
USE this to assign:
    SELECT coalesce(department,'Unassigned department'), count(*) 
    FROM employee 
    GROUP BY department;
